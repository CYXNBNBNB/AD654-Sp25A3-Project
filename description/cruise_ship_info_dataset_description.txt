Dataset: cruise_ship_info.csv

This dataset provides technical and operational specifications for a collection of cruise ships across various cruise lines. Each row represents a unique ship and includes data related to ship size, capacity, and staffing.

Variable Descriptions:

1. Ship_name:
   The name of the cruise ship.

2. Cruise_line:
   The cruise company or brand operating the ship (e.g., Carnival, Azamara, Royal Caribbean).

3. Age:
   The age of the ship in years at the time of data collection.

4. Tonnage:
   The gross tonnage of the ship, a measure of the ship's overall internal volume.

5. passengers:
   The average number of passengers the ship is designed to carry under normal occupancy conditions.

6. length:
   The overall length of the ship, usually measured in hundreds of feet or meters depending on source format.

7. cabins:
   The number of cabins available for guest accommodations onboard.

8. passenger_density:
   A measure of the number of passengers per tonnage of the ship (passengers / tonnage), often used to infer crowding levels.

9. crew:
   The total number of onboard crew members assigned to the ship.

This dataset is useful for fleet comparison, operational planning, cruise industry benchmarking, and machine learning applications like classification and clustering (e.g., predicting cruise line based on ship characteristics).
